# Understanding Multimodel Driving Data
The repository dedicated for first project of the Deep Learning for Autonomous Driving course at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

The fundamental goal of the project is to visualize the outputs of autonomous driving tasks such as 3D object detection and point cloud semantic segmentation given a LiDAR point cloud, the corresponding RGB camera image and the ground truth semantic labels.

### Tasks:
- **1.** Displaying Bird's Eye View with pixel intensities corresponding to the points' respective reflectance values.
- **2.a** Projecting the point cloud onto the image space.
- **2.b** Projecting 3D Bounding boxes of all given vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians of the given scene.
- **3.** Identifying the laser ID of each point in a given 3D point cloud.
- **4.** Removing motion distortion from LiDAR points caused by the vehicle motion with the aid of GPS/IMU data and projecting them to the image space.

### Respiratory Structure
- `data`: A directory containing the dataset.
- `figures`: A directory containing outputs of the tasks.
- `utils`: A directory containing utility functions.
- `notebooks`: A directory containing EDA and LDA visualization notebooks.

### Results
Here are the results of the tasks.
